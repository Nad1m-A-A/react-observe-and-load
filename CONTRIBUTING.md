## Code Style Guide

### JavaScript/React Style Guide

* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Use semicolons at the end of statements
* Use single quotes for strings
* Use const/let instead of var
* Use arrow functions when possible
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add JSDoc comments for functions and components
* Keep functions small and focused
* Use destructuring when possible

### Example

```javascript
// Good
const MyComponent = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect logic
  }, []);

  return <div>{prop1}</div>;
};

// Bad
function MyComponent(props) {
  var state = null;
  
  useEffect(function() {
    // Effect logic
  }, []);
  
  return <div>{props.prop1}</div>;
}
```

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * 🎨 `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * 🐎 `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * 🚱 `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * 📝 `:memo:` when writing docs
    * 🐛 `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * 🔥 `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * 💚 `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    * ✅ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * 🔒 `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * ⬆️ `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    * ⬇️ `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies
